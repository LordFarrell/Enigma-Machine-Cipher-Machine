#### Frequency Analysis
Provides three views:
1. **Input Text Analysis** - Letter frequencies of plaintext
2. **Output Text Analysis** - Letter frequencies of ciphertext
3. **Comparison Mode** - Side-by-side frequency comparison

Statistical measures:

- Uses bigram analysis to identify likely plaintext
- Configurable test phrase
- One-click application of discovered settings

**Plugboard Analysis**
- Analyzes letter substitution patterns
- Suggests plugboard connections with confidence scores
- Based on frequency of consistent substitutions
- Helps recover unknown plugboard settings

### Configuration Management

#### Save/Load Settings
- **Save Config**: Store current machine state to browser storage
- **Load Config**: Restore previously saved configuration
- **Export**: Generate base64 configuration code
- **Import**: Load configuration from code

#### Historical Presets
- **Default**: Standard Wehrmacht configuration
- **Wehrmacht Daily Key**: Historical military settings
- **Kriegsmarine Setting**: Naval Enigma configuration

### Encryption Process
1. **Key Press** ‚Üí Rotor advancement
2. **Plugboard substitution** (if configured)
3. **Right rotor** encoding
4. **Middle rotor** encoding

4. **Frequency Analysis**: Compare encrypted vs. random text
5. **Historical Messages**: Decrypt actual WWII messages

## üîê Security Notes

**Historical Context**: The Enigma machine was considered unbreakable during WWII, but was eventually defeated through:
- Mathematical analysis (Polish cryptographers)
- Known plaintext attacks (weather reports, standard phrases)
- Mechanical exploitation (Turing's Bombe)
- Operational errors (repeated message keys, predictable messages)

**Modern Relevance**: While historically significant, Enigma is now purely educational. Its security was based on:
- Large key space (158 quintillion possible settings)
- Daily changing keys
- Additional security through operational procedures

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Machine won't encrypt**
- Ensure rotors are properly selected (no duplicates)
- Check that positions are valid letters (A-Z)
- Verify ring settings are 1-26

**Plugboard connections not working**
- Click two different letters to connect
- Click a connected letter to disconnect
- Maximum 10 pairs allowed

**Can't decrypt message**
- Ensure exact same settings as encryption
- Rotor positions must match starting positions
- All plugboard connections must be identical
